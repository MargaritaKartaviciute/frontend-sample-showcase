# BlankViewer

Each of the geometry samples makes use of the `BlankViewer` to visualize different types of `geometry`. The `BlankViewer` is different from your traditional `Viewer`, since it does not require an iModel, instead allowing you to use a [BlankConnection](/?step=BLANKCONNECTION). The `BlankConnection` has several of the same properties as an `IModelConnection`, such as location and extents. The `BlankViewer` also uses a [BlankConnectionViewState](/?step=BLANKCONNECTIONVIEWSTATE), which acts similar to a traditional `ViewState`.
